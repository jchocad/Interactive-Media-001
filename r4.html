				1.Why does <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/" class="p_link">Laurel Schwuls </a>(Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.

			</h3>

			<p>
				Laurel Schwuls advocates for individual websites over social media because Laurel Schwuls believes a website was a self-identity of an artist. In the article, she has pointed out that she thinks the network, the web should use servers with people, not support and base on few big companies, such as Google and Twitter. Laurel Schools is a metaphor website as a horse, a garden, a river, a place that all design by yourself and places to show yourself, but social media was putting adversities then people, so Laurel Schwuls advocate website more than social media. In my opinion, I do not agree with Laurel Schwuls’s thinking. I think a website can show the artist’s personality mostly. Still, at the same time, I think the website was like a completely finished shop which was like an exhibition, and social media more as a notebook to record the process. I think both were places for an artist to show their self-identity but only worked in different ways.

				2.In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.
