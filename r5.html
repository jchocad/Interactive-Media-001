				The Poetry of Tools   by Mindy Seu <div class="link icon"></div></a>

			<h3>
				1.In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
 
			</h3>

			<p>
				In Seu’s article, Seu is talking about how people using digital tools to create a digital poem. Seu has felt a charm in the digital poem. she thinks technology was just a tool. In her opines, the mouse we use, the screen shows in front of us, the layout of any software was both simplified processing. Which was already automation for the user, not what they are really were. And most of the user was used of it. So that, I think what Seu has asked to “defamiliarized our tool” was meaning to reconsider the tool we use. For example, most of the tool we use was have set a limit for using because of it was too many messages. Seu was telling us to think about the limit of the tool, add and use the tool to expands our thinking.

			<h3>
				2.Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.



			</h3>

			<p>
				In Seu’s article, Performing data was one of the categories of her taxonomy of tool poetics. In this stage, Performing data was a category that includes the tool poetics which was reorganization by the data that was hidden in the tool. For a better user experience, most of the tools will hide their data, Performing data was taking out this kind of data and make them visualization, organize and combine. In a reflective or critical way to present the data, to makes it become a tool poetics. I have found an interesting example of Performing data. 
				<a href="https://www.codex-atlanticus.it/" class="p_link">Codex Atlanticus</a> was a digital library website collection of Leonardo Da Vinci’s journals and notebooks. This website organizes all  Leonardo’s journals and notebooks into different categories corresponding to different colours. It makes the data process be visualization, to create visual art, which was a tool poetics.
