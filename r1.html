			<h3>
				1.What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?
			</h3>

			<p>
				I feel challenges when I need to turn my feelings into a meaningful sentence and say it out so that other people can get useful critiques from me. Most of the time, when I look at other people's works, I will have many feelings about it but I can’t say it out in a short time. I will need time to deal with my thinking. I also feel it is difficult to comment on something that I think needs to be improved.
			</p>

			<h3>
				2.How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?
			</h3>

			<p>
				Usually, when I need to critique something that I disagree with, I will need to ask myself first, do my opinions have too many personal preferences? As the article has written, a critique should not Criticize humanity, so I think to give critiques need to stay neutral and objective as much as if you can. I think it was important between is it I disagree because I don't like the style, or I disagree because I think it can be improved. And then, I will ask myself that how should I told others if I disagreed with his work. My goal was to communicate with others, not quarrel with others. So I will need to be careful with my language and try to give the direction of improvement.
			</p>

			<h3>
				3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?
			</h3>

			<p>
				In my opinion, I think critiques were a change to let other people point out what you didn't find, In most of the times, the creator may not notice their mistake others people have found. When people work on a thing for a long time, they will be used to the mistake, because they are used to being wrong.  A good critique can let people learn and excited to use it on the next project. it can let artists get a chance to see other people's works, to think about why other people do this, and to give time for the artist to also review your own work on the opinions you give to others.
