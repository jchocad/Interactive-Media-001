					Here is my blank canvas, waiting for me to putting colour on it. This canvas was unlimited. And I am showing this canvas in front of all the people who can assist this website, this exhibition. 
			        
			        This canvas was me; I will cover the colour on it with my hand. It shows who I am and what I am. I may suddenly change my colour, or I may add some news after few years. 
			        
			        If you have time, I may want you to use it a few times, stand in front of my canvas. Then, when you are enough for my canvas, you may go to see otherâ€™s people canvas.
